# bootstrap-datepicker

This is a fork of https://github.com/eternicode/bootstrap-datepicker which is a fork of Stefan Petre's [original code](http://www.eyecon.ro/bootstrap-datepicker/);
All credits go out to them

## Changes
The options I added are
*   maxViewMode for limiting the viewmode to, say, year/month selection
*   oneYearOnly for automatically ( based on start-/endDate's year ) generating a calendar for one year only, So next / prev year selection is disabled and you can accept format's like dd-mm ( without year ).
